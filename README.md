# CS330_Final_Project

In my final project for CS 330, I decided to recreate a simple scene from my kitchen countertop. This scene includes basic objects such as a butter dish, a plate, and fruit. My goal was to focus on applying the fundamental techniques we’ve learned in the course, such as working with textures, lighting, and camera movement, rather than overcomplicating the design with intricate details.

New Learnings and Applications:

One of the new things I learned during this project was how to apply textures and lighting in a way that makes the 3D objects look more realistic. The process of binding textures and adjusting the shaders for the material was a challenge initially, but it gave me a better understanding of how light interacts with different materials in a scene. This helped me give the butter dish and the plate a reflective quality and the fruit a more polished look. I also gained experience manipulating object transformations such as scaling, rotating, and translating objects in the 3D space.

Questions I Still Have:

Although I was able to implement basic lighting and texture mapping, I still have some questions regarding more advanced lighting techniques, like how to achieve softer shadows or more dynamic light sources. Additionally, I’d like to further explore how to create more complex shapes using basic primitives without increasing polygon counts too much. I also wonder how to better optimize my scene for performance without sacrificing too much detail.

Future Use of Skills:

The skills I've gained in computational graphics, especially in applying textures and lights, will be extremely useful in future projects, whether I’m working on 3D visualizations, game design, or simulations. I see myself expanding on these skills in the context of software development, as understanding how to represent and manipulate objects in 3D space is a valuable skill across multiple industries. It could also enhance my work on personal projects like creating visualizations for mobile or web applications.
